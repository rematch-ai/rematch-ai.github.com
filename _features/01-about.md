<h2>Image-based profiling for deep phenotyping of small molecules</h2>  
{:.text-center}
High-content imaging provides a cost-effective solution to capture a broad range of biological responses, however, analysis of such data requires extensive expertise and data processing pipelines. We remove the bottleneck to convert huge amount of high-content screening images to interpretable data for drug discovery and repurposing.

We provide:
1.  High performant, cloud-based image analysis tools
2.  State of the Art machine learning to mine vast data from image-based screens
3.  Long standing expertise in assay development and image-based screening campaigns accelerating drug discovery
